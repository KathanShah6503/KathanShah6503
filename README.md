## 🧩 Backend Engineering

- Designed & maintained 40+ REST APIs serving internal & external users
- Built data-intensive endpoints handling high-volume CRUD & bulk write operations
- Implemented transactional consistency across MongoDB & PostgreSQL
- Designed RBAC-based access control systems
- Wrote complex joins, aggregations & pagination queries
- Reduced MongoDB log-write API latency from 30s → <10s using BulkWrite & indexing
- Implemented retry logic, structured logging, standardized error handling & input validation
- Applied caching & pagination strategies for traffic optimization
- Worked across monolithic & microservices architectures
